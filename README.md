# SimpleRedditBot
A very simple reddit bot that uses PRAW, python reddit API wrapper, and will search through a given subreddit and user and reply with a friendly message.
# What I learned
* What a wrapper and API is
  * How to read and find documentation
* A nice review of some very basic python
  * Loops
  * Conditional statements
