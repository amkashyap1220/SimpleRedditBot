# SimpleRedditBot
A very simple reddit bot that uses PRAW, python reddit API wrapper, and will search through a given subreddit and user and reply with a friendly message.
# What I learned
* What a wrapper and API is
  * How to read and find documentation
* A nice review of some very basic python
  * Loops
  * Conditional statements
# How to use
* You **must** edit the praw.ini file in order for this bot to work
 * [You may want to choose to follow the PRAW quickstart guide in order to set up praw.ini](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html#common-tasks)
